# 2. Chemical Reactor
Scope of the Project
The project has been developed keeping in view the requirements of the end user. The utility has been developed for a dynamic environment in a structured manner to enable later modifications easily.
Our project is concerned with chemical reactions and their simulation. For this we have to understand about some basic characteristics reactions like how they proceed, affect of time, concentration and some constants on them etc. Hence some information is provided about these basic aspects regarding a chemical reaction.

 * It had been developed using C graphics.

# 5. n-queen Promblem

This is a recursive algorithm strategy called backtracking. A backtracking algorithm tries to build a solution to a computational problem incrementally. Whenever the algorithm needs to decide between two alternatives to the next component of the solution, it simply tries both options recursively.
Front end software : Turbo C
User interface : CGI
